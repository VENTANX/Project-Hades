## Overview

**Project Hades** is a secure AI inference platform designed to deploy **uncensored local AI models** (via KoboldCPP) while ensuring complete data privacy. In an environment of increasing digital surveillance, Hades serves as a secure enclave for your interactions.

The system is architected for **remote accessibility without compromise**. You can host Hades on a central server and access it securely from any device—mobile or desktop—knowing that all conversations, chat logs, and API credentials are **encrypted at rest** using military-grade encryption.

## Key Features

-   **KoboldCPP Integration**: Seamlessly connect to local LLMs running via KoboldCPP for an unrestricted, uncensored AI experience.
-   **Secure Remote Access**: Host locally, access globally. The responsive design ensures a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
-   **Encrypted Architecture**: All sensitive data (chats, keys) is safeguarded with **Fernet (symmetric) encryption**. Even if the database is accessed, the content remains unreadable without the specific key.
-   **No Telemetry**: Zero tracking, zero external dependency. Your data never leaves your controlled environment.

## Technical Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite.
-   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy.
-   **Encryption**: Python `cryptography` (Fernet).
-   **AI Backend**: Compatible with **KoboldCPP** (and other OpenAI-compatible endpoints).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.8+**
-   **Node.js 18+**
-   **KoboldCPP** (running a model of your choice)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**.
2.  **Backend Setup**:
    ```bash
    cd "project hades"
    pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy cryptography python-dotenv
    ```
3.  **Frontend Setup**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Deployment

1.  **Launch KoboldCPP**:
    Start your KoboldCPP instance with your preferred model. Note the URL (usually `http://localhost:5001`).

2.  **Start Hades Backend**:
    ```bash
    python backend/main.py
    ```

3.  **Start Hades Interface**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Connect**:
    Open the interface in your browser. In the settings or initial setup, point Hades to your KoboldCPP URL.
