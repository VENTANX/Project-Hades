## Overview

**Project Hades** is a secure, decentralized AI interface designed for the modern privacy-conscious user. It solves a critical problem: **how to utilize powerful local AI models hosted on a primary machine while accessing them securely from any other device.**

With Hades, you can run **KoboldCPP** on your high-performance desktop and connect to it from your laptop, smartphone, or tablet over the web/network. The platform ensures that despite this remote accessibility, your **conversations and data remain encrypted and completely private**. It effectively turns your local AI into a personal, secure cloud service that only you control.

## Key Features

-   **Remote-Ready AI**: Host your models on one machine (e.g., a gaming rig with high VRAM) via KoboldCPP and access the Hades interface from anywhere.
-   **Uncensored Freedom**: Designed to work seamlessly with uncensored local models. No guardrails, no corporate oversight.
-   **Zero-Trust Encryption**: All chat history and session data are encrypted using **Fernet (symmetric) encryption**. Even if you access the platform over a network, your data stored on the host remains locked and readable only by you.
-   **Responsive Design**: A unified UI that adapts perfectly to desktop and mobile workflows.

## Technical Architecture

The system is built to bridge the gap between local compute and remote usability:

1.  **AI Host**: Runs KoboldCPP (or compatible API) exposing the model.
2.  **Hades Core**: The React + Vite frontend connects to the AI Host.
3.  **Security Layer**: The Cryptography module ensures that persistent data is never stored in plaintext.

## Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite.
-   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI.
-   **Security**: Python `cryptography` (Fernet).
-   **Integration**: KoboldCPP / OpenAI API standards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.8+**
-   **Node.js 18+**
-   **KoboldCPP** (running on your host machine)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**.

2.  **Backend Setup**:
    ```bash
    cd "project hades"
    pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy cryptography python-dotenv
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage Scenario: Remote Access

1.  **On your Host Machine:**
    -   Launch KoboldCPP with your model. Ensure it allows network connections (e.g., `--host 0.0.0.0` if needed).
    -   Start the Hades Backend: `python backend/main.py`.
    -   Start the Frontend: `npm run dev -- --host` (to expose it to the network).

2.  **On your Remote Device (Phone/Laptop):**
    -   Open the browser and navigate to your Host Machine's IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.X:5173`).
    -   In the Hades settings, point the "Nexus Gateway" to your KoboldCPP API URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.X:5001`).
    -   **Enjoy full, encrypted access to your high-powered AI from the comfort of your mobile device.**
